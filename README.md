# Flipping a Biased Coin - Probability Distribution

This Python code simulates flipping a biased coin and visualizes the probability distribution of the outcomes (heads and tails) based on a specified number of trials.

## Description

In this code, we simulate the process of flipping a biased coin with the following probabilities:
- Probability of getting a "Head": 0.7
- Probability of getting a "Tail": 0.3

We then perform a specified number of trials and record the outcomes in a sample. By analyzing the sample, we calculate and visualize the discrete probability distribution, showing the likelihood of getting "Head" and "Tail" in the simulated coin flips.

## Requirements

To run this code, you'll need the following libraries installed:
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` for data visualization
- `seaborn` for improved data visualization

You can install these libraries using pip:
```
pip install numpy  
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
```
## Output
The code will produce a bar chart that displays the discrete probability distribution for the outcomes of flipping the biased coin.
The chart will show the probabilities of getting "Head" and "Tail" based on the number of trials specified.
